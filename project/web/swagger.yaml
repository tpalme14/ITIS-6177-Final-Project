        Accepts a publicly accessible image URL and returns a list of descriptive tags found in the image with 
        a confidence score for each tag. These tags help provide a high-level understanding of the image content.
        Useful for categorization, indexing, or content-based filtering.

        Accepts a publicly accessible image URL and returns objects present in the image along with their bounding boxes and confidence scores.
        Also identifies parent-child relationships between objects (e.g., a "tree" as a child of "plant").
        Useful for spatial analysis, object detection use cases, and scene understanding.

        Accepts a publicly accessible image URL and returns a human-readable description (caption) of the image with a confidence score, along with relevant tags.
        The caption attempts to summarize the image content in a single sentence.
        Useful for accessibility, alt-text generation, or general content summarization.

        Accepts a publicly accessible image URL and returns basic metadata about the image, including its height, width, and format.
        This endpoint does not analyze the image content but provides information about the image file itself.
        Useful for validating image dimensions or type before processing.
